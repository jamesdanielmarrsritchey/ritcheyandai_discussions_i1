jamesdanielmarrsritchey: What is the difference between AI, and machine learning?

GitHub Copilot: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad concept that refers to machines or software exhibiting intelligence similar to humans. It's the overarching discipline that covers anything related to making machines smart.

Machine Learning (ML), on the other hand, is a subset of AI. It's a method of data analysis that automates the building of analytical models. It's based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. In other words, ML is one of the ways we're trying to achieve AI.
