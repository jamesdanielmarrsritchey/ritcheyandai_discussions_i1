jamesdanielmarrsritchey: What is PHP?

GitHub Copilot: PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular open-source, server-side scripting language that is widely used for web development. It can be embedded into HTML and it's particularly suited for web development and creating dynamic web pages. It can interact with many different database languages including MySQL. PHP scripts are executed on the server and the result is returned to the browser as plain HTML.

jamesdanielmarrsritchey: What are the basics of PHP?

GitHub Copilot: Here are some of the basics of PHP:

1. **Syntax**: PHP scripts start with `<?php` and end with `?>`. A PHP file normally contains HTML tags, and some PHP scripting code.

```php
<?php
// PHP code goes here
?>
```

2. **Variables**: In PHP, a variable starts with the `$` sign, followed by the name of the variable. PHP variables are case-sensitive.

```php
<?php
$text = "Hello, World!";
$number = 10;
?>
```

3. **Echo and Print Statements**: Both are used to output data to the screen. The differences are small: echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1, and echo can take multiple parameters while print can take one argument.

```php
<?php
echo "Hello, World!";
print "Hello, World!";
?>
```

4. **Data Types**: PHP supports eight primitive data types: four scalar types (boolean, integer, float, and string), two compound types (array and object), and finally two special types (resource and NULL).

5. **Arrays**: An array stores multiple values in one single variable.

```php
<?php
$cars = array("Volvo", "BMW", "Toyota");
?>
```

6. **Functions**: A function is a block of statements that can be used repeatedly in a program. A function will not execute immediately when a page loads, but it will execute when it is called.

```php
<?php
function writeMsg() {
  echo "Hello, World!";
}
writeMsg(); // call the function
?>
```

7. **Conditional Statements**: PHP supports conditional statements like `if`, `else` and `elseif`, `switch`.

8. **Loops**: PHP supports loop statements like `while`, `do-while`, `for`, `foreach`.

9. **Error Handling**: PHP has several ways to handle errors; showing errors directly to the user, adjusting the error reporting level, creating custom error handling functions.

10. **Form Handling**: PHP provides several ways to manipulate the data that is submitted from a form, like saving it to a database, sending an email, or returning a response to the user.

Remember, PHP is a server-side language, so the PHP code is processed on the server and the resulting HTML is sent to the client's browser.
