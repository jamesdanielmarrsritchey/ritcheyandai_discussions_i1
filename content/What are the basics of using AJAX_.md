jamesdanielmarrsritchey: What are the basics of using AJAX?

GitHub Copilot: AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications. With AJAX, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page.

Here are the basic steps to use AJAX:

1. Create an XMLHttpRequest object: This object allows you to perform HTTP requests.

```javascript
var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
```

2. Define a callback function: This function will be called when the state of the request changes.

```javascript
xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
       // Typical action to be performed when the document is ready:
       console.log(xhttp.responseText);
    }
};
```

3. Open a connection: Specify the type of request (GET or POST), the URL, and whether the request should be handled asynchronously or not.

```javascript
xhttp.open("GET", "ajax_info.txt", true);
```

4. Send the request: If the request type is POST, you may need to send some parameters.

```javascript
xhttp.send();
```

Here's a complete example:

```javascript
var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
       console.log(this.responseText);
    }
};
xhttp.open("GET", "ajax_info.txt", true);
xhttp.send();
```

This example sends a GET request to "ajax_info.txt" and logs the response text when the request is successful.
