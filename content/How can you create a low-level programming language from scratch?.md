GitHub Copilot: Creating a low-level programming language from scratch is a complex task that involves several steps. Here's a high-level overview:

1. **Define the language**: Decide on the syntax, semantics, and features of your language. This is usually done in a formal language specification.

2. **Create a lexer**: This is a program that takes a string of characters (the source code) and breaks it down into tokens, the smallest units of meaning in the language.

3. **Create a parser**: This takes the tokens produced by the lexer and organizes them into a parse tree, a data structure that represents the syntactic structure of the code.

4. **Create a semantic analyzer**: This takes the parse tree and checks it for semantic errors, like type mismatches or undefined variables.

5. **Create a code generator**: This takes the parse tree (or an intermediate representation) and generates machine code or bytecode.

6. **Create a runtime system**: This is the environment in which your programs will run. It might include a garbage collector, a system for handling exceptions, and more.

7. **Create a standard library**: This is a set of functions and types that are available to programs written in your language.

Here's a very simplified example of a lexer and parser in Python for a hypothetical language:

```python
import ply.lex as lex
import ply.yacc as yacc

# Define the lexer
tokens = ('NUMBER', 'PLUS', 'MINUS')

t_PLUS = r'\+'
t_MINUS = r'-'
t_NUMBER = r'\d+'

def t_error(t):
    print(f"Illegal character '{t.value[0]}'")
    t.lexer.skip(1)

lexer = lex.lex()

# Define the parser
def p_expression_plus(p):
    'expression : expression PLUS term'
    p[0] = p[1] + p[3]

def p_expression_minus(p):
    'expression : expression MINUS term'
    p[0] = p[1] - p[3]

def p_expression_term(p):
    'expression : term'
    p[0] = p[1]

def p_term_number(p):
    'term : NUMBER'
    p[0] = int(p[1])

def p_error(p):
    print(f"Syntax error at '{p.value}'")

parser = yacc.yacc()

# Test it out
while True:
    try:
        s = input('calc > ')
    except EOFError:
        break
    if not s: continue
    result = parser.parse(s)
    print(result)
```

This is a very basic calculator language that supports addition and subtraction. It's a long way from a full-featured language like C or C++, but it's a start.

Creating a low-level language like C or C++ would involve a lot more work, including generating machine code, managing memory, and more. You would also likely need to write parts of the compiler in a low-level language like C or assembly.
