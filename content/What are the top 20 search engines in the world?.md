jamesdanielmarrsritchey: How do search engines work?

GitHub Copilot: Search engines work by using algorithms to scan or "crawl" the web to build an index of websites. This process involves three key steps:

1. **Crawling**: Search engines use web crawlers, also known as spiders or bots, to visit webpages. These bots follow links on these pages to discover and visit additional pages.

2. **Indexing**: Once a page is crawled, the search engine analyzes the content and other elements of the page, such as images and videos, to understand what the page is about. This information is stored in a large database known as an index.

3. **Ranking**: When a user enters a query, the search engine uses complex algorithms to pull relevant pages from its index. These pages are ranked based on numerous factors, including relevance to the search query and the quality of the website.

This is a simplified explanation and the actual process involves many more complexities and technologies.
