jamesdanielmarrsritchey: Does storing two copies of a file on the same drive partition still provide some protection against file corruption, since each byte exists twice?

GitHub Copilot: Storing two copies of a file on the same drive partition does provide some level of protection against file corruption, but it's not a foolproof method. If the drive itself fails, both copies of the file could be lost. Similarly, if there's a corruption at the file system level, both copies could be affected. 

For better protection against file corruption, consider using a backup solution that stores copies of your files on a different drive, or even better, in a different physical location. This could be an external hard drive, a network-attached storage device, or a cloud-based storage service. 

Additionally, using a file system that includes built-in error checking and correction, such as ZFS or Btrfs, can also help protect against file corruption. 

Remember, the best protection against data loss is a good backup strategy.
