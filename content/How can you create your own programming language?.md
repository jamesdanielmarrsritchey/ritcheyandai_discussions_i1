jamesdanielmarrsritchey: How can you create your own programming language?

GitHub Copilot: Creating your own programming language is a complex task that involves several steps. Here's a high-level overview:

1. **Define the Purpose of the Language**: Understand what you want to achieve with your language. Is it a scripting language, a system language, or a domain-specific language?

2. **Design the Language**: This involves defining the syntax, semantics, and features of the language. You might want to write a formal specification of your language.

3. **Implement the Language**: This usually involves writing a lexer, a parser, and a compiler or interpreter. The lexer breaks the code into tokens, the parser constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the tokens, and the compiler or interpreter executes the AST.

4. **Test the Language**: Write tests to ensure your language behaves as expected.

5. **Document the Language**: Write documentation so others can learn and use your language.

Here's a simple example of a lexer and parser in Python using the `ply` library:

```python
import ply.lex as lex
import ply.yacc as yacc

# Define the lexer
tokens = ('NUMBER', 'PLUS', 'MINUS')

t_PLUS = r'\+'
t_MINUS = r'-'
t_NUMBER = r'\d+'

def t_error(t):
    print(f"Illegal character '{t.value[0]}'")
    t.lexer.skip(1)

lexer = lex.lex()

# Define the parser
def p_expression_plus(p):
    'expression : expression PLUS term'
    p[0] = p[1] + p[3]

def p_expression_minus(p):
    'expression : expression MINUS term'
    p[0] = p[1] - p[3]

def p_expression_term(p):
    'expression : term'
    p[0] = p[1]

def p_term_number(p):
    'term : NUMBER'
    p[0] = int(p[1])

def p_error(p):
    print(f"Syntax error at '{p.value}'")

parser = yacc.yacc()

# Use the language
while True:
    try:
        s = input('calc > ')
    except EOFError:
        break
    if not s: continue
    result = parser.parse(s)
    print(result)
```

This is a very basic calculator language that can add and subtract numbers. Creating a full-featured programming language would involve much more complexity.

jamesdanielmarrsritchey: What is a lexer?

GitHub Copilot: A lexer, also known as a tokenizer or scanner, is a program that transforms a sequence of characters (source code) into a sequence of tokens. Tokens are meaningful character strings that represent a unit of information in the source code.

The process of lexing involves scanning the source code from left to right, character by character, and grouping them into tokens based on a set of predefined rules. These tokens are then passed to the parser for the next stage of the compilation or interpretation process.

For example, consider this line of code in Python:

```python
x = 10 + 20
```

A lexer would break this down into the following tokens:

1. `x` (identifier)
2. `=` (assignment operator)
3. `10` (integer)
4. `+` (addition operator)
5. `20` (integer)

Each of these tokens represents a meaningful unit in the Python language. The lexer doesn't try to understand or evaluate the code, it just breaks it down into these tokens. The parser then takes these tokens and tries to understand the structure of the code based on them.

jamesdanielmarrsritchey: What is the role of a parser in the compilation process?

GitHub Copilot: A parser in the compilation process takes the tokens produced by the lexer and arranges them in a way that represents the structure of the program. This structure is often represented as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

The parser checks the tokens against the grammatical rules of the language to ensure they form valid statements and expressions. This process is known as syntax analysis or parsing.

For example, consider the following expression:

```
3 + 4 * 5
```

The lexer would produce the tokens `3`, `+`, `4`, `*`, and `5`. The parser would then arrange these tokens into an AST that represents the correct order of operations (according to the rules of the language), like so:

```
  +
 / \
3   *
   / \
  4   5
```

This tree represents the expression `3 + (4 * 5)`, which correctly applies the rule that multiplication should be performed before addition.

If the tokens do not form a valid program according to the language's grammar, the parser will produce a syntax error. The parser may also produce warnings if it encounters code that is technically correct but likely to be a mistake.

After the parsing stage, the AST can be used for further stages of the compilation process, such as semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.
