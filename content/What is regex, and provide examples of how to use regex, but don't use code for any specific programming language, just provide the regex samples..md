jamesdanielmarrsritchey: What is regex, and provide examples of how to use regex, but don't use code for any specific programming language, just provide the regex samples.

GitHub Copilot: Regex, short for Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. It can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations. Here are some examples of regex patterns and their descriptions without tying them to any specific programming language:

1. **Matching an Email Address:**
   - Regex: `\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b`
   - Description: Matches a basic email address with common characters before the `@`, a domain name, and a domain suffix of two or more letters.

2. **Validating a Phone Number (US Format):**
   - Regex: `\(?\d{3}\)?[-.\s]?\d{3}[-.\s]?\d{4}`
   - Description: Matches US phone numbers in various formats, including optional parentheses around the area code and different separators like spaces, hyphens, or dots.

3. **Checking for a Valid IP Address:**
   - Regex: `\b\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\b`
   - Description: Matches an IP address, ensuring each octet is between 0 and 255. Note: This does not validate the numeric range of each octet.

4. **Finding Hexadecimal Colors:**
   - Regex: `#?([a-fA-F0-9]{6}|[a-fA-F0-9]{3})`
   - Description: Matches hexadecimal color codes, with or without the `#`, in both three (e.g., `#fff`) and six (e.g., `#ffffff`) digit formats.

5. **Validating a Date (YYYY-MM-DD Format):**
   - Regex: `\b\d{4}[-]\d{2}[-]\d{2}\b`
   - Description: Matches dates in the format of YYYY-MM-DD, ensuring there are four digits for the year, two for the month, and two for the day.

6. **Matching a Username:**
   - Regex: `^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]{3,16}$`
   - Description: Matches a username that is 3 to 16 characters long and can contain letters, numbers, dots, underscores, or hyphens.

7. **Finding HTML Tags:**
   - Regex: `<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)`
   - Description: Matches HTML tags, capturing the tag name, attributes, and content between the opening and closing tags.

8. **Password Strength Check:**
   - Regex: `^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}$`
   - Description: Ensures a password is at least 8 characters long and contains at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character.

These examples illustrate the versatility of regex for various common tasks involving pattern matching and validation in strings.

jamesdanielmarrsritchey: Provide more examples, including some very basic ones.

GitHub Copilot: Certainly, here are more regex examples, including some basic ones for common tasks:

1. **Matching Any Single Character:**
   - Regex: `.`
   - Description: Matches any single character except newline characters.

2. **Matching Specific Characters:**
   - Regex: `[abc]`
   - Description: Matches any one of the characters `a`, `b`, or `c`.

3. **Excluding Specific Characters:**
   - Regex: `[^abc]`
   - Description: Matches any character that is not `a`, `b`, or `c`.

4. **Matching Characters in a Range:**
   - Regex: `[a-z]`
   - Description: Matches any lowercase letter from `a` to `z`.

5. **Matching Digits:**
   - Regex: `\d`
   - Description: Matches any digit (0-9).

6. **Matching Non-Digits:**
   - Regex: `\D`
   - Description: Matches any character that is not a digit.

7. **Matching Word Characters:**
   - Regex: `\w`
   - Description: Matches any word character (letters, digits, or underscore).

8. **Matching Non-Word Characters:**
   - Regex: `\W`
   - Description: Matches any character that is not a word character.

9. **Matching Whitespace:**
   - Regex: `\s`
   - Description: Matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, line breaks).

10. **Matching Non-Whitespace:**
    - Regex: `\S`
    - Description: Matches any character that is not a whitespace character.

11. **Matching the Beginning of a Line:**
    - Regex: `^`
    - Description: Matches the beginning of a line or string.

12. **Matching the End of a Line:**
    - Regex: `$`
    - Description: Matches the end of a line or string.

13. **Matching Zero or More Occurrences:**
    - Regex: `a*`
    - Description: Matches zero or more occurrences of the letter `a`.

14. **Matching One or More Occurrences:**
    - Regex: `a+`
    - Description: Matches one or more occurrences of the letter `a`.

15. **Matching Zero or One Occurrence:**
    - Regex: `a?`
    - Description: Matches zero or one occurrence of the letter `a`.

16. **Matching Exactly N Occurrences:**
    - Regex: `a{3}`
    - Description: Matches exactly 3 occurrences of the letter `a`.

17. **Matching N or More Occurrences:**
    - Regex: `a{3,}`
    - Description: Matches 3 or more occurrences of the letter `a`.

18. **Matching Between N and M Occurrences:**
    - Regex: `a{3,5}`
    - Description: Matches between 3 and 5 occurrences of the letter `a`.

These examples cover a wide range of basic to intermediate regex patterns, useful for various text processing tasks.
