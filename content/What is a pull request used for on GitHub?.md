jamesdanielmarrsritchey: What is a pull request used for on GitHub?

GitHub Copilot: A pull request on GitHub is used to propose changes to a codebase. It allows you to:

1. Submit contributions to a project: You can make changes to a project's code and then use a pull request to propose those changes to the project's maintainers.

2. Review and discuss changes: Pull requests provide a forum for discussing proposed changes before they're merged into the project. This can include code reviews, general discussions, or detailed explanations about the changes.

3. Track changes: Pull requests record the history of changes, discussions, and decisions. This makes it easier to understand why decisions were made.

4. Integration with CI/CD: Pull requests can trigger Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment processes, allowing automated testing and deployment of the changes.

5. Merge changes: Once the changes have been reviewed and approved, the pull request can be used to merge the changes into the main codebase.
