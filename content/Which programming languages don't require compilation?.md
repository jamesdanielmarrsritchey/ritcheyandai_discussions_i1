jamesdanielmarrsritchey: Which programming languages don't require compilation?

GitHub Copilot: Several programming languages do not require explicit compilation to machine code before execution. These are often referred to as interpreted languages. Here are a few examples:

1. Python
2. JavaScript
3. Ruby
4. PHP
5. Perl
6. Shell scripting languages (like Bash)
7. Lua
8. R

These languages are typically executed by an interpreter, which reads and executes the code line by line. However, it's worth noting that many modern interpreters for these languages do some form of "just-in-time" compilation to improve performance, but this is generally transparent to the user.

jamesdanielmarrsritchey: What is the difference between a programming language, and a scripting language?

GitHub Copilot: The terms "programming language" and "scripting language" are often used interchangeably, but there are some subtle differences:

1. **Programming Language**: This is a broad term for any language that can be used to create software or algorithms. Programming languages are typically used for creating standalone applications and they can be compiled or interpreted. Examples include C, C++, Java, Python, and many others.

2. **Scripting Language**: This is a type of programming language that is typically interpreted and used for automating tasks that could be done manually by a user. Scripting languages are often used for writing short scripts for tasks like text processing or automating system tasks. They are also used extensively for web development. Examples include JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Perl, and Bash.

In summary, all scripting languages are programming languages, but not all programming languages are used for scripting. The distinction is more about the typical use cases and execution model of the language rather than any fundamental difference in the languages themselves.
