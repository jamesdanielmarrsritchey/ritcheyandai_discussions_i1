jamesdanielmarrsritchey: What are the newest programming languages?

GitHub Copilot: As an AI, I don't have real-time data access, but as of my last update, some of the newer programming languages include:

1. Rust: A system programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.
2. Julia: A high-level, high-performance dynamic language for technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments.
3. Elm: A domain-specific programming language for declaratively creating web browser-based graphical user interfaces.
4. Ballerina: A cloud-native programming language designed for the intersection of networked software applications.
5. V: A simple, fast, safe, compiled language for developing maintainable software.
