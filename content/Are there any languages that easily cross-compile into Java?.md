jamesdanielmarrsritchey: Are there any languages that easily cross-compile into Java?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, there are several languages that can be cross-compiled into Java bytecode, which means they can be run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Here are a few examples:

1. **Kotlin**: A statically typed programming language developed by JetBrains. It is fully interoperable with Java and can be compiled to Java bytecode.

2. **Scala**: A statically typed language that is designed to integrate features of object-oriented programming and functional programming. It also compiles to Java bytecode.

3. **Groovy**: A dynamic language for the JVM that can be used as a scripting language. It can be compiled to Java bytecode as well.

4. **Clojure**: A dialect of the Lisp programming language that runs on the JVM. It compiles directly to JVM bytecode.

5. **JRuby**: An implementation of the Ruby programming language atop the JVM.

6. **Jython**: An implementation of the Python programming language that can run on the JVM.

Remember, while these languages can be cross-compiled to Java bytecode and run on the JVM, they each have their own syntax and semantics, and may not support all features of Java or behave in exactly the same way.
