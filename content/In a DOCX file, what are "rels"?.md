jamesdanielmarrsritchey: In a DOCX file, what are "rels"?

GitHub Copilot: "Rels" or ".rels" files in a DOCX file are part of the Office Open XML (OOXML) specification, which is the default file format for Microsoft Office documents. 

The ".rels" files are located in the "_rels" directories of the unzipped DOCX file and they define the relationships between different parts of the document. They are XML files that specify what resources are associated with the document and how they are connected. 

For example, a ".rels" file might specify the relationship between a document and its embedded images, stylesheets, or other media. It can also define relationships between the document and external resources. 

In short, ".rels" files are crucial for understanding the structure and dependencies of a DOCX file.

jamesdanielmarrsritchey: How do you create a .rels file?

GitHub Copilot: Creating a .rels file manually can be complex as it involves understanding the Office Open XML (OOXML) specification. However, here's a basic example of how you might create a .rels file manually:

1. Create an XML file with the extension .rels.
2. The root element of the file should be `<Relationships>`, which is in the namespace `http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/package/2006/relationships`.
3. Inside the `<Relationships>` element, you can define one or more `<Relationship>` elements. Each `<Relationship>` element should have an `Id`, `Type`, and `Target` attribute.

Here's a basic example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<Relationships xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/package/2006/relationships">
    <Relationship Id="rId1" Type="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/officeDocument" Target="word/document.xml"/>
</Relationships>
```

In this example, the .rels file specifies a relationship with an `Id` of "rId1". The `Type` attribute specifies that this is a relationship with an Office document, and the `Target` attribute specifies that the target of this relationship is the "word/document.xml" file.

However, in most cases, you would not create .rels files manually. Instead, you would use a library or tool that understands the OOXML specification, such as Apache POI for Java or Open XML SDK for .NET. These tools can create .rels files for you when you create or modify DOCX files.
